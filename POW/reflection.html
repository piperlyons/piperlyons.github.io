        <p>This was a surprisingly easy POW compared to the ones we had in 6th grade, which took at least 2 days of working
          after school for a while, but it was still a fun process, and I enjoyed having some prompted extensions. One thing that made
          it easy is that we were all able to solve it in class, in contrast to the 2 days last year, one thing that made this problem
          fun was that there were a lot of steps that had to be taken, so then it was more challenging than a problem that would be
          in a worksheet, and I really liked the extensions because they require critical thinking and an imaginative mind 
          to get them which is fun and challenging, I did attempt the 2nd and the 3rd extensions, but I wasnâ€™t able to solve them.</p>
